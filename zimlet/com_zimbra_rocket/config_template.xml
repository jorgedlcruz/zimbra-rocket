The rocket Zimbra server extension automatically creates
accounts for each Zimbra account in Rocket, to enable account
creation set createRocketAccount = true

accountCreateInteger (for migration purposes)

Whenever the account has been created by Zimbra the accountCreateInteger
on the Users Zimlet userProperties is incremented. The Zimlet will not
re-attempt to create the users account, unless the accountCreateInteger
in the Users Zimlet userProperties is < the one set in the Zimlets configuration
template. 

This will help you in case you want to run a fresh install of Rocket, but with
an existing deployment of Zimbra OR in case you merge multiple Zimbra instances
to a single instance. In which case you can increment the accountCreateInteger
in the configuration template to make sure all users have their account
created.
